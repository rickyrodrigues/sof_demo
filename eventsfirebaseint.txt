## **Project Documentation: Displaying Firestore Events on a Web Page**

This document outlines the steps taken to fetch event data from a Firebase Firestore database and display it on a web page, including initial setup, common errors, and their resolutions.

### **I. Goal**

The primary goal was to display event data, stored in a Firebase Firestore database, on a web page, specifically in a calendar and as a list of event cards.

### **II. Firebase Firestore Setup**

1.  **Firebase Project Creation:**

      * A Firebase project was created in the Firebase Console (console.firebase.google.com).
      * A Firestore Database was initiated within this project (either in production mode or test mode, with appropriate security rules adjusted later).

2.  **Firestore Data Structure (`events` collection):**

      * A collection named `events` was created.
      * Each document within this `events` collection represents a single event.
      * **Crucially, each event document contains a `date` field, which is of Firestore's `Timestamp` data type.** Other fields include `title`, `description`, `location`, `imageUrl`, `registrationUrl`, `ageGroup`, `ageGroupDisplay`, and `quote`.

    *Example Event Document Structure:*

    ```
    /events/{documentId}
        - title: "Community Worship Service" (string)
        - description: "Join us for our weekly worship service..." (string)
        - date: (Timestamp: June 5, 2025 at 9:00:00 PM UTC+5:30)
        - location: "Main Hall" (string)
        - imageUrl: "https://example.com/worship.jpg" (string, optional)
        - registrationUrl: "https://example.com/register" (string, optional)
        - ageGroup: "all-ages" (string)
        - ageGroupDisplay: "All Ages" (string)
        - quote: "A time of fellowship and spiritual growth." (string, optional)
    ```

3.  **Firebase Security Rules:**

      * Initially, strict security rules often prevent client-side reads. To allow the web page to fetch data, the Firestore security rules for the `events` collection were set to allow read access.
      * **Rule Modified:**
        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /events/{eventId} {
              allow read: if true; // Allows anyone to read from the 'events' collection
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      * **Important Note:** `allow read: if true;` is suitable for initial testing but should be replaced with more secure rules (e.g., role-based access, authenticated users) for production environments.

### **III. Web Page (HTML & JavaScript) Integration**

The core logic for displaying the calendar and event cards resides in a JavaScript file (or embedded `<script>` tag) and interacts with HTML elements.

1.  **HTML Structure (`events.html`):**

      * The HTML file contains the basic structure for the calendar (header, navigation buttons, grid for days) and a section for event cards.
      * Key IDs for JavaScript interaction:
          * `#currentMonthYear`: To display the current month and year in the calendar header.
          * `#calendarGrid`: The container for the calendar days.
          * `#prevMonth`, `#nextMonth`: Buttons for calendar navigation.
          * `#eventPopup`: A `div` for displaying event details on day click.
          * `#events-grid`: The main container where event cards are rendered.

2.  **JavaScript (`script.js` or embedded `<script type="module">`):**

      * **Firebase SDK Imports (Crucial Fix):**

          * Initial attempts used bare module specifiers like `import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';`.
          * **Problem:** Browsers running directly from the file system (or without a build tool) do not resolve these bare specifiers, leading to `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "firebase/app". Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".`
          * **Solution:** Changed imports to full CDN URLs for Firebase SDKs (e.g., `https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.1/firebase-app.js`).

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        import { initializeApp } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.1/firebase-app.js';
        import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs, query, orderBy } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.1/firebase-firestore.js';
        ```

      * **Firebase Configuration:**

          * The `firebaseConfig` object containing the project's API key, auth domain, project ID, etc., was included.
          * **Validation:** Ensuring this configuration was correct was vital for establishing a connection to the Firestore database.

      * **`EventCalendar` Class:**

          * A JavaScript class `EventCalendar` encapsulates the calendar and event display logic.
          * `constructor()`: Initializes `currentDate` and `events` array, then calls `init()`.
          * `init()`: An asynchronous function that orchestrates the loading of events, rendering the calendar, and setting up event listeners.
          * `loadEvents()`:
              * Fetches documents from the `events` Firestore collection, ordered by `date`.
              * Populates the `this.events` array with fetched data.
              * **Debugging during this phase involved `console.log` statements to verify:**
                  * `Raw events fetched from Firestore:` to ensure data was received from the database.
                  * Checking the Network tab in browser DevTools for Firestore requests (status 200 OK or errors).
                  * Inspecting the `Response` payload in the Network tab to confirm data content.
          * `renderCalendar()`: Renders the calendar grid based on `currentDate`, adding "event dots" to days that have associated events.
          * `getEventsForDate()`: Filters `this.events` to find events for a specific calendar day. **Crucially, it handles the Firestore `Timestamp` conversion to JavaScript `Date` objects (`new Date(event.date.seconds * 1000)`).**
          * `showEventPopup()`: Displays a small popup with event details when a calendar day with an event is clicked.
          * `renderEventCards()`:
              * Clears the existing event cards in `#events-grid`.
              * Filters `this.events` to only include `upcomingEvents` (where `event.date` is greater than or equal to the current date/time).
              * Iterates through `upcomingEvents` and calls `createEventCard()` for each, appending the resulting HTML to `#events-grid`.
              * **Debugging during this phase involved `console.log` statements to verify:**
                  * `Upcoming events after filtering:` to ensure events were not being inadvertently filtered out (e.g., if all events in Firestore were in the past).
                  * `Upcoming events rendered successfully. Total cards:` to confirm the rendering loop was entered.
                  * `No upcoming events found. Displaying placeholder.` to check if the no-events message was triggered.
          * `createEventCard()`: Generates the HTML string for a single event card based on the event data.
              * **Crucial Fix for Visibility:**
                  * Initial code added `class="event-card fade-in"` to the card HTML.
                  * **Problem:** The `.fade-in` CSS rule sets `opacity: 0;`, making the card invisible by default, as the corresponding `.visible` class was never added.
                  * **Solution:** Modified the `createEventCard` function to include the `visible` class directly: `class="event-card fade-in visible"`. This made the cards immediately visible upon rendering.
          * `setupEventListeners()`: Attaches click handlers to the "Previous Month" and "Next Month" buttons.

      * **Initialization:**

          * `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { new EventCalendar(); });` ensures the calendar is initialized only after the entire HTML document has been loaded and parsed.

### **IV. Debugging Process & Key Resolutions**

1.  **"Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier..." (Firebase imports):**

      * **Cause:** Using bare module specifiers without a build tool or proper server environment.
      * **Resolution:** Switched to full CDN URLs for Firebase SDK imports.

2.  **No Events Visible / No Cards Showing:**

      * **Initial thought:** Firebase connection or security rules.
      * **Debugging steps:**
          * Checked browser console for `FirebaseError` (e.g., "Missing or insufficient permissions").
          * Used Network tab in DevTools to inspect Firestore requests (status codes and response data).
          * Verified Firestore security rules (`allow read: if true;`).
          * **Crucial `console.log` statements were added in JavaScript:**
              * `Raw events fetched from Firestore (before filtering): Array(...)` confirmed data retrieval.
              * `Upcoming events after filtering: Array(...)` confirmed the filtering logic was working as expected and events were considered "upcoming."
              * This ruled out data fetching and filtering as the primary issue.
      * **Root Cause Identified (No Errors, Still Nothing Visible):**
          * The event cards were being rendered with `opacity: 0;` due to the `.fade-in` CSS class.
          * The JavaScript code was not adding the `.visible` class which would set `opacity: 1;`.
      * **Resolution:** Modified the `createEventCard` function to include both `fade-in` and `visible` classes (`<div class="event-card fade-in visible">`) to ensure immediate visibility.

### **V. Future Improvements / Considerations**

  * **Firebase Security Rules:** Implement more granular and secure Firestore security rules for production.
  * **Loading States:** Add loading indicators while fetching data from Firestore.
  * **Error Handling (UI):** Display user-friendly messages on the UI if events fail to load.
  * **Animation:** If the `fade-in` animation is desired, implement an Intersection Observer API to add the `visible` class when cards scroll into view.
  * **Deployment:** For production, consider using a build tool (Webpack, Parcel, Vite) or a hosting service (Firebase Hosting) to handle module resolution and other optimizations, allowing bare module imports again.
